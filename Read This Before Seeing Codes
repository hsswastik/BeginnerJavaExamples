There is few things you need to know before seeing the code


In Java, if a loop statement contains only a single logical statement, you can exclude the use of brackets. This applies to both for loops and if statements. 
It allows for a more concise and readable code structure. 

ex: 
for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++)
    System.out.println(i);

Additionally, you can use the enhanced for-each loop to easily iterate over elements in an array, eliminating the need for manual indexing and providing a simpler syntax.

ex:
int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
for (int number : numbers) {
    System.out.println(number);
}
